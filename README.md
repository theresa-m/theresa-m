I'm a computer engineer with an interest in sharing knowledge to help other developers get the most out of their tools.

I've spent 5 years working on open source JVM and compiler projects. These days I've pivoted to try my hand at developer relations. I talk about how Java engineers can use their JDK to write more secure code.

When I'm not working on open source, you'll find me spending time with my latest foster dog or cat. I also love spending as much time as I can in the great outdoors.
